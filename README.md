## Contributing

Contribution is welcome, but please create an appropriately-named branch for your work.
Issues are filed under branches, which can be found with the following command:
```git branch -a```
If you find the branch you would like to work on, checkout the branch with the following command:
```git checkout branch_name```
For example, if you are working on README updates, please checkout the README updates branch with the following command:
```git checkout readme_updates```
If you cannot find the appropriate branch for the work you are doing, feel free to create a new branch. First, ensure that you are currently in origin/main. You can check this with ```git status```
If you are not, checkout branch main. Ensure that you are on the current version of the project with ```git pull```. When you are, use the following command to create a new branch:
```git checkout -b "branch_name"```

Branch names are spaced with ```_``` and use lowercase capitalization. Make sure to pull when returning to a branch that has been previously checked out.

Before you submit your work, make sure to resolve conflict errors on your end by checking your work again main by performing the following steps:
1. Checkout main 
```git checkout main```
2. Pull
```git pull```
3. Checkout branch
```git checkout branch_name```
4. Merge main into branch
```git merge main```

Correct merge conflicts if they exist.
Next: stage, commit, and push your changes via your preferred git tool, such as terminal or Visual Studio Code extension.
